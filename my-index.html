					<p>I think virtual reality is an amazing technology because many people enjoy discovering and experiencing new things.<br>
						There are two main types of VR headset: inside out tracking, and outside in tracking; better known as base station tracking. <br>
						Inside out tracking is the type of headset that have cameras fixed to it that constantly video feed your surroundings and tells the headset where you are. 
						The drawbacks to this type is that it needs to be able to see the controllers to really interact with them, so if they were behind your back or something they wouldnt register. 
						The more popular version is base station tracking, which allows a greater range of movement. 
						This is because the tracking system is placed externally, in small devices that can be placed around the room. The headset compatible with this is fitted with sensors instead of cameras. 
						The base stations use a laser to sweep the room, which triangulates your location by communicating with the sensors on the headset and other compatible controllers. <br>
						There are a plethora of different genres of games that you can play, there really is an option for anyone. Check it out today!
